# NYC Housing Price Prediction (Machine Learning)

A Python project that predicts residential housing prices in New York City using supervised machine learning.  
This project applies data analysis and regression models to understand how location, property characteristics, and housing type influence price.

---

## Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Build and evaluate predictive models for NYC housing prices and compare linear and tree-based approaches.

**Data:**  
NYC housing dataset containing property characteristics, location information, and sale prices.

**Techniques:**  
Data cleaning (IQR outlier filtering), feature engineering, regression modeling, cross-validation, and model interpretation.

## Key Features

- Cleans and standardizes real-world housing data  
- Removes extreme price outliers using IQR filtering  
- Compares multiple regression models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting  
  - XGBoost / LightGBM  
  - CatBoost  
- Evaluates performance using RMSE, MAE, and R²  
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted prices and model errors

## Why It Matters
Demonstrates my ability to:

- Work with messy real estate data  
- Apply supervised machine learning to regression problems  
- Compare baseline and ensemble models
- Present results clearly
